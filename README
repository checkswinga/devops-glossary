A starter repo for DevOps artifacts, mostly documentation at the moment.

Check out the Commands Programs and Concepts text file for the beginnings of a hopefully eventually colossal, on-the-fly encyclopedia of CLI commands, troubleshooting guides and concepts for DevOps engineers and software configuration management specialists.


**My DevOps philosophy:**

1) To be service oriented (difficult as it is).* My goal on any DevOps team would be to create and maintain a platform that provides services to different teams so they can do their job: delivering applications.

2) Understanding the big picture of an applicationâ€™s delivery framework, including:
    - workflow of its delivery process
    - the tools involved
    - teams involved
    - things not yet present but desired and need to be future planned

3) When something breaks or does not work and you are not sure where to begin:
    - identify the problem as best you can
    - look up the error/issue (the exact error if you can)*. This includes anything that you see in output that can be Google searched. If you cannot find a definite answer or solution:
    	a) what are your options so far for this issue?
	b) what, if any, workarounds can you implement temporarily?
	c) who can you reach out to to help you troubleshoot and come up with a permanent solution (including internal and external teams)?

4) Create a plan for a team that involves:
    - the entire delivery model* for the application, including desired items (#2) above)
    - a checklist of high, medium and low priority items composed of fixes, improvements, required or potential research items, and future planning
    - a day-to-day support model page containing usage and support details for the toolchain being used by developers, with items such as:
    	a) how to onboard/gain access to tools
	b) infrastructure allocation and capacity
	c) issues and when/how to engage the DevOps team
	d) how to engage DevOps team for requesting new features)
