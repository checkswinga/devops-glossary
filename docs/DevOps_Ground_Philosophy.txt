#### Solutioning ####
- define the problem statement
- define the effort required to manually execute on dealing with the problem without trying to workout a better solution
- define the change in behaviour we want to see with the implementation of something new
- finding a route towards the solution
	- discarding steps that don't work towards it
- identifying the right things to measure when it comes to value
- MOST IMPORTANT: getting the protocol right (how things will talk to each other)

- abstracting away the complexities for clients
	- e.g. Github Actions, Openshift


#### Continuous Delivery ####

- limit WIP items



#### Post-implementation ####

- measuring the outcome vs the effort to implement (though in some cases, effort to implement can and should be validated)


#### Monitoring ####

- removing stuff that is no longer useful, needs to be removed
- what is worth keeping
- what is delivering value
- getting feedback


#### Management ####

#### Dealing with Negatives ####

- it's tough to stop bad ideas
	- try to gracefully ask and find out what is the projected goal of the idea and the vision behind it
