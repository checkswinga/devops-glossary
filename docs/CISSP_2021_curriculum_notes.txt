		to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behaviour.

		2] Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification


	- The Four Canons of Ethics [in order of importance]

		1] Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure

		2] Act honourably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally

		3] Provide diligent and competent service to principals

		4] Advance and protect the profession


		- note: if theres ever a conflict between canons, the one that ranks the highest is the one to adhere to first


# ISC² CISSP Exam Prep Notes

- expect approx. 15% of the questions to be about security and risk management


# EU GDPR [2016]

- provisions
	- companies must inform authorities of major data breaches within 24 to 72 hours, depending on country 
	- each EU member nation must create a centralized data protection authority
	- individuals must have access to their own data
	- information regarding an individual must be transferrable to another service provider at the individuals request

	- prohibits the circumvention of copyright protections on digital media


# Intellectual Property Protections

- patents - protects the holders exclusive right to use, create and sell an invention.
		  - terms are typically 20 years

- trademarks - typically protect brandings, logos, slogans, anything that creates a distinction between one product and a similar product

- copyrights - protect art, music, literature, source code created by an individual or organization
			 - infringement is when the above is used without the permission of the owner
			 - copyright usually includes the year the work was copyrighted
			 - licenses enable a copyright owner to grant specific uses of the material to others 

- trade secrets - the protection of confidential information about how a product is created.

##### CISSP Module 2: Security and Risk Management #####

Pg. 26 – Security Roles
 
- Senior Manager
	- Principally in charge of an organization’s security
	- Delegate security solutions to security professionals
 

- Security Professional
	- Experienced security, network and system engineers who perform the tasks delegated by the senior manager such as designing and implementing security solutions based on the org’s security policy
	- Write security policies but typically do not make policy decisions
	- May sometimes share duties with system admins in smaller environments
	- Dedicated to security tasks such as reviewing server audit data
 

- Data Owner
	- Responsible for classifying sensitive data
 

- Data Custodian
	- Responsible for managing and securing data within an organization
	- Also responsible for performing backups, monitoring data integrity, and managing storage
 

- End User
	- Anyone who has access to secure data
	- Responsible for following the organization’s security policy and procedures
	- Privileges and permissions are based on principle of least privilege (i.e. the required access to perform their tasks)
 
- Auditors
	- Responsible for verifying that an organization’s security policy is sufficient and is being implemented correctly.
	- Will produce reports that should be reviewed by the senior manager
 

 

Pg. 54 – Qualitative Risk Equation
 

- Risk = Thread x Vulnerability x Impact
 
 

Pg. 57 – Quantitative Risk Equation
 
- ARO x SLE = ALE
	- Annualized Rate of Occurrence x Single Loss Expectancy = Annualized Loss Expectancy
 

- AV x EF = SLE
	- Asset Value x Exposure Factor = Single Loss Expectancy
 

ALE - The average yearly cost of the risk
ARO – the frequency at which a risk event occurs
E.g. a printer breaks twice a year, the ARO is 2. If a flood is estimated to occur once every 100 years, the ARO is 0.01
SLE – the cost of a single loss, including the cost of materials, the technical service hours required, and loss of productivity that is experienced because of the loss
	- $500 to buy a workstation, $100 to hire a technician to install it, $200 in lost productivity for employee who needs it, SLE is $800
AV – Asset Value – the value of the asset, including any data stored on the asset
EF – Exposure Factor – the percentage of value that is lost when a risk event occurs
Failure of a laptop’s display, EF = 10%
Theft of a laptop, EF = 100%
 

 

Pg 59-60 – Responses to Risk
 
Risk acceptance – company chooses to leave an asset unprotected rather than undergo time/expense to protect it
Risk avoidance – eliminates use of a technology/service altogether rather than be exposed to the risks that could be incurred by implementing the technology or service
Risk mitigation – lowers chance that a risk event occurs or lowers damage that a risk event causes
Risk elimination – completely remove the chance for a risk event to occur
Risk transfer – shifts the risk to another party, such as an insurance company
Risk denial – not an acceptable method of handling risk. If a company believes a risk does not exist or insignificant, it should accept the risk.
 

 

Pg. 61-67 – Threat Modeling


Methodologies to assess threat modeling
DREAD
STRIDE
Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA)
Trike
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
 

 

DREAD – classification methodology that is used to rank threats numerically
	Damage – How much damage will be caused?
		- 0 = no damange
		- 10 = complete destruction
	Reproducibility – How easy is it to reproduce?
		- 0 = impossible
		- 10 = easy and without authentication
	Exploitability – What is needed to exploit the threat?
		- 0 = advanced knowledge and tools
		- 10 = a web browser
	Affected Users – How many users will be affected?
		- 0 = none
		- 10 = all
	Discoverability – How easy is it to discover the threat?
		- 0 = nearly impossible and source code or administrator access is required
		- 10 = visible in a web browser address bar or in a form
 

Sum of the 5 ratings divided by 5 to calculate final risk from 0 to 10. The higher the risk score, the greater the risk.
 


STRIDE – an aggregated threat-modeling methodology that was developed by Microsoft to characterize known threats.
Spoofing – Gaining access by using a false identity
Tampering – Modifying data in transit or in storage
Repudiation – Denying that an action was performed by an individual
Information Disclosure – Revealing or distributing information to unauthorized individuals
DoS – Preventing authorized use of a resource
Elevation of privilege – Gaining unauthorized access, rights, or privileges
 

 
PASTA – a platform-agnostic, risk-based, threat-modeling methodology that focuses more on the attacker than the target.
Stage I – Definition of the Objectives (DO) for the Analysis of Risks
Stage II – Definition of the Technical Scope (DTS)
Stage III – Application Decomposition and Analysis (ADA)
Stage IV – Threat Analysis (TA)
Stage V – Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis (WVA)
Stage VI – Attack Modeling & Simulation (AMS)
Stage VII – Risk Analysis & Management (RAM)
 

Trike
	- uses data flow diagrams to allow security audits to be performed consistently, reliably, and repeatably
	- assigns an acceptable risk level to each class of asset
	- helps to determine the appropriate risk response
 

SCAP – National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard protocol that provides common sets of criteria for defining and assessing security vulnerabilities (that applications can also use to scan and score systems, hardware or software that it needs or would like to use).
	- data maintained in   NVD – National Vulnerability Databases
 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) – defines naming system for describing vulnerabilities
Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System (CVSS) – defines a standard scoring system for vulnerability severity
Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) – defines a naming system for system configuration problems
Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) - defines a naming system for applications, devices and operating systems
Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) – defines a language format for security checklists
Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) - defines a language format for security testing procedures
 
 
-------------
Pg. 68 – CVSS
-------------

Definition: an open standard that helps to indicate the severity of vulnerabilities and to prioritize responses to those vulnerabilities

Scoring: influence by three metrics groups:

	Base
		indicate the severity of the vulnerability
		established by the vendor or originator
		have the largest influence over the final CVSS score

	Temporal
		indicate the urgency of the vulnerability
		established by the vendor or originator
		can change over time

	Environmental
		indicate how much an environment or end-user organization is affected by the vulnerability (optional)
