		- never fully caught on because of advancement of DIMMs


- 32 or 64 bit data path refers to number of bits of data transferred in 1 cycle
	- bit - the smallest form of data that the computer reads
	- 8 bits = 1 byte
  - 64 / 8 = 8 byte wide bus
  - 32 / 8 = 4 byte wide bus



 # 7) Printers

 - printers allow the ability to print documents or pictures onto paper
 - usually connects to computer via USB or parallel cable
 	- can also connect through a network connection
 	- network share - where other computers on your network can use your local printer [as long as your computer is on]

 	- types:

 		- non-impact printers
 			- print without striking an ink ribbon onto paper

 				- inkjet
 					- most common printers for home use
 					- more affordable than laser printers
 					- print head moves back and forth across paper
 						- places ink on paper in very tiny dots
 					- 2 ink cartridges: black and colour
 						- can produce photo quality results
 						- ink can smudge

 				- thermal
 					- print by using heat
 					- user thermal paper, which has wax-based ink
 					- as heat is applied to ink, it turns black
 					- print head applies heat to areas where ink should be placed
 					- ink becomes permanent when cooled
 					- very quiet
 					- commonly used for printing labels and barcodes

 				- laser
 					- come in different sizes
 					- provide highest quality of print
 					- most expensive
 					- method:
 						- electric charge placed on rotating drum
 						- laser discharges lower electric charge on drum
 						- laser draws image that is going to be printed on the drum itself
 						- drum is coated with a fine black powder known as "toner", which will only cling to the laser drawn parts of paper
 						- toner is placed on paper

 		- impact
 				- dot matrix
 					- very old tech, mediocre print quality
 					- very noisy, but very durable and last a long time
 					- the pins on the print head strike against a cloth ink ribbon that comes in direct contact with the paper, producing characters in the form of dots
 					- can print multi copy docs such as carbon copies


# 8) Cooling

- very important to a computer since they generate a lot of heat
- if components not adequately cooled, computers can overheat and:
	- run slow
	- lock up
	- shut down
	- shorten the life of the computer
- biggest heat generators come from the CPU and video card

- types:

	- case fans
		- intake fan - the fan mounted at front, sucks air in
		- exhaust fan - mounted at the back, pushes air out
			- when they work together, its known as "active cooling"

	- heat sink [CPU]
		- CPU running without a cooling component would fry itself in 10 seconds, needs heat sink to dissipate the heat
		- an aluminum block with fins that directly makes contact with CPU
		- increases surface area of CPU so it can make more air contact for cooling
		- fins increase surface area for air circulation
			- heat transfers to heat sink fins for air to cool
			- known as "passive cooling"
		- to attach the heat sink to the CPU, the CPU needs "thermal paste" applied evenly to its surface
			- fills in microscopic gaps on CPU surface, for maximum contact and heat transfer

	- water cooling
		- inclues pump, hosing, and radiator
			- unit is placed directly on CPU (from the pump side)
			- pump circiulates the water throughout the unit to keep the CPU cool
			- when water reaches the radiator, radiator mounted fan takes in air to cool the water
			- cycled is repeated
		- cools far better than air cooling
		- quieter than air cooling
		- more expensive than air cooling



# 9) Random Access Memory (RAM)

- RAM is primary memory or temporary storage
	- in order for a program to run, needs to be loaded into RAM first
	- if memory is too low, hard drive has to hold some of the data for the RAM, which slows down the computer since HDD has to still send the data to the RAM once its free
		- in that case, add more RAM :D
	- requires constant electrical power to store data
	- RAM is stored on motherboard in modules called DIMMs
		- come in different sizes
		- 128MB to 4GB per DIMM

- Types:

	- Dynamic RAM [DRAM]
		- contains capacitors
		- has to be refreshed often [electricity]

	- Synchronous RAM [SRAM]
		- uses transistors
		- does NOT have to be refreshed
		- faster than DRAM
		- very expensive
		- examples: memory cache used by CPU

	- Synchronous DRAM [SDRAM]
		- used today in RAM DIMMs
		- difference between SDRAM vs. DRAM
			- DRAM - operates asynchronously with the system clock
			- SDRAM - operates synchronously with the system clock
								- all signals are tied to the system clock for better controlled timing

		- SDRAM Speeds:
			- eg. PC-100 256MB SDRAM
				- 100 Mhz = the speed at which it operates
				- 8 byte wide bus
				- 100 Mhz x 8 bytes = 800Mbps

	- DDR RAM [Double Data Rate]
		- sends double the amount of data in each clock signal
			- non-DDR uses only the rising edge of the clock signal to send data
				- DDR uses both, hence twice as fast
	
		- labelling diff - unlike SDRAM, DDR uses the total bandwidth in its labelling 
				- eg. PC-2700 512MB DDR RAM
					- 333 * 8 bytes = 2700Mbps (roughly)

		- 184 pins

	- DDR2 RAM
		- higher bus speeds with less power than DDR
		- 240 pins
		- eg. PC2-3200 DDR2 1GB DDR2 RAM

	- DDR3 RAM
		- twice as fast as DDR2
		- bandwidths of over 12800 Mbps
		- 240 pins
			- unlike DDR/DDR2, bottom notches are in different places, so cannot mix and match DDR/DDR2 and DDR3 RAM on the same motherboard
		- eg. PC3-8500, PC3-12800

	- RDRAM
		- developed by Rambus Inc., debuted in 1999 [a breakthrough at the time]
		- RIMM - Rambus Inline Memory Module
		- look similar to DIMMs: 184 pins, but notches located in center of module
		- ran at 800 MHz [at the time SDRAM was 133 Mhz]
			- downside: only had a 2 byte wide bus
		- designed to work with a continuous signal
			- all other memory slots must be in use/filled in
				- could install C-RIMM [Continuity RIMM] or dummy RIMM can be used to fill space as well


	- Dual Channel Mode
		- motherboard must be equipped to work in this mode
		- DIMMs must be identical to each other
		- DIMMs must be inserted into the motherboard in a specific slot configuration


	- Error Correcting Code [ECC RAM]
		- detects if the data was correctly processed by the memory module
		- makes a correction if it needs to
		- ECC has 9 memory chips, while non ECC has 8
			- most modules are non-ECC with the advancement of RAM and less errors
		- mostly used in servers as extra precaution to guard against memory errors


# 10) CPU, Socket and Chipset

- CPU socket - a square plastic or metal holder with multiple holes on the motherboard where CPU is placed
						 - pins at the bottom of the CPU make physical and electrical contact with the holes
						 - "ZIF - Zero Insertion Force"
						 		- modern CPU socket name - means CPU is installed on the socket with no force [slots in easily]


						 - different types of socket designs called "packages"

						 		- "PGA - Pin Grid Array"
						 			- typical square ZIF socket design with holes and a lock down lever

						 			-	Types of PGA
						 				- Socket 1 [1989]
						 					- 169 pins and used intel 486 processor

						 				- Socket 370
						 					- had 370 pins, used the Intel Pentium 3 processor

						 				- Other egs.
						 					- Socket A
						 					- Socket 754
						 					- Socket 939
	


						 		- Slot package
						 			- CPU utltilized a type of expansion slot interface called "SECC - Single Edge Contact Cartridge"
						 				- CPU is housed inside plastic cartridge and then inserted into motherboard in a simliar slot to an expansion slot
						 			- made its debut with Pentium II in 1997 [design was called "Slot 1"]


						 		- LGA - Land Grid Array
						 			- latest design
						 			- meta casing with a door that closes over the CPU, locked down with a lever
						 			- has pins that make contact with bottom of the processor
						 			- LGA processor itself has pads that rest on the LGA socket pins

						 				- egs.
						 					- LGA 775 - 775 pins, designed for the Pentium 4 and Pentium Dual Cores
						 					- LGA 1156 - 1156 pins
						 					- LGA 1366 - 1366 pins



- CPU [Central Processing Unit]

	- main component on a motherboard, the brain of the computer where all data processing/calculations takes place
	- largest component made up of CPU socket, CPU, heat sink and fan
	- speed is measured in MHz
		- 1 MHz = 1 million cycles per second
		- 500 MHz = 500 million cycles per second
		- 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second

	- CPU core - where the reading and execution of instructions takes place
		- single core - processes instructions one at a time
			- hence multi-core for better performance


	- CPU manufacturers
		- Intel
			- largest manufacturer of processors
			- founded in late 60s
			- dominated CPU market
			- examples: 286, 386, 486, Celeron, Pentium

		- AMD [Advanced Micro Devices]
			- 2nd largest manufacturer of procsesors
			- founded in late 60s, didnt start competing with Intel in CPU space until mid 1990s
			- examples: K5, K6, Athlon, Duron, Sempron, Athlon 64, Opteron, Phenom


	- 32 vs 64 bit
		- the difference is the way it handles memory
		- 32 bit - 2^32 bytes of memory = 4 GB
		- 64 bit - 2^64 byes of memory = 16 Exabytes
			- 4 billion times more memory than 32 bit. So huge that its virtually unlimited


  - data processing
  	- data stored on HDD -> loaded into RAM -> CPU can access the data to run program
  		- using 32 bit RAM, may not be able to hold enough data that CPU needs to run program efficiently


  - CPU memory cache
  	- made of SRAM [Static RAM] - very fast memory
  	- processors internal memory
  	- holds data and instructions waiting to be used by the processor
  		- holds more common data it thinks CPU is going to access over and over
  		- CPU checks memory cache first before going to primary memory [RAM]

  	- Level 1 [L1] or primary cache
  		- located on the processor itself
  		- runs at same speed as CPU

  	- Level 2 [L2] external cache
  		- used to catch recent data access from processor not caught by L1 cache
  		- CPU checks L2 if L1 doesnt have data, then goes to RAM if L2 doesnt have it
  		- located on separate chip on motherboard, or on processor
  		- larger than L1 cache but not as fast



  - Chipset

  	- a smaller set of chips that have replaced a larger amount of chips
  	- control data flow between CPU, peripherals, bus slots and memory
  	- consists of north and south bridge
  		- north bridge
  			- located near CPU
  			- connects the memory and AGP/PCI-E slots together
  				- i.e.. CPU goes through north bridge to talk to RAM, also has to go through it to talk to PCI-E

  		- south bridge
  			- lower part of the motherboard
  			- connects IDE ports, PCI slots, USB and SATA ports

  		- north and south bridge are connected
  		- north bridge is faster than south bridge
  			- higher speed components are connected to north bridge


  		- bus - a pathway or set of pathways that allows data and signals to travel between components on a motherboard

  			- eg. 66 MHz bus - sends data at 66 million cycles per second
  				- higher the bus speed, the faster the computer performs

  			- "front side bus" - the connection between the CPU and the north bridge chipset


# 11) Bus Slots

- aka expansion slots - can plug in a sound card, USB expansion card, etc. 
- all motherboards have I/O bus slots
- typically located at bottom rear of motherboard

- Types:

	- ISA - Industry Standard Architecture

		- old and slow, succeeded by faster PCI slots


	- PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect
		- modern bus type
		- developed in 1993
		- 32 or 64 bit data path
		- 133 - 533 Mbps
		- half the size of the ISA slot


	- AGP - Accelerated Graphics Port [brown]
		- created to assist in accelerating 3D computer graphics
		- faster than standard PCI
		- has its own dedicated pathway to the processor [instead of going through the north bridge]
		- only used for video card


	- PCI-E - PCI Express [yellow]
		- latest version of bus slots
		- faster than PCI
		- up to 4GB/s
		- transfers data in serial [hence faster]
		- designed to succeed all other bus slots
		- not backward compatible

		- PCI-E slot sizes
			- PCIe x1
				- has 1 lane for data
					- a lane has 4 wires: 2 for sending, 2 for receiving
			- PCIe x4
				- has 4 lanes for data
			- PCIe x8
				- has 8 lanes for data
			- PCIe x16
				- has 16 lanes for data
				- has succeeded the AGP slot for the video card 

		- AMR - Audio/Modem Riser [brown]
		  - on older motherboards 
			- allows manufacturers to create motherboards that didnt have analog input/output functions [such as modem or sound expansion card]
			- developer in 1998
			- about half the size of standard PCI slot
			- software driven
			- not plug and play compatible

		- CMR - Communications and Networking Riser [brown]
			- designed to be improvement over AMR
			- can be either software or hardware driven
			- plug and play compatible
			- becoming obsolete with better integrated components in newer motherboards


# 12) PATA Interface


- Parallel ATA or EIDE [Extended Integrated Drive Electronics]

- definition: an interface standard for attaching drives to a computer [hard drives, CD and DVD-ROM drives]
- 40 pin ribbon cable as its connector
- 2 drives per cable 
	- one master, one slave
- each drive designated by a jumper setting
	- jumper is a small, short length conductor used to close an electrical circuit
	- located on back of each drive
	- settings are either master, slave or cable select
		- if drive is plugged into/set to cable select, it will automatically configure itself as master or slave depending on their position on the cable

- older motherboards came with 2 PATA interfaces
	- total 4 PATA drives can be attached to these computers
	- PATA being replaced by SATA

		- if both ends of a cable are using the same standard
		- allows signals to pass through from end-to-end
		- to connect computers to dissimilar devices together (e.g. from a PC to a modem)
		- most commonly used
	- crossover cable
		- if both ends of a cable are using 2 different standards
		- to connect to similar devices together

- wiring standards
	- 568A
		- order of wires: white-green, green, white-orange, blue, white-blue, orange, white-brown, brown
	- 568B [more commonly used]
		- order of wires: white-orange, orange, white-green, blue, white-blue, green, white-brown, brown
	- no difference in functionality between standards


- categories
	- the difference being the max speed they can handle without interference/crosstalk
	- the numbers represent the tightness of the twist that are applied to the wires
		- CAT3 - 10 Mbps - obsolete
		- CAT5 - 100 Mbps - obsolete
		- CAT5e - 1 Gbps - Enhanced
		- CAT6 - 1 Gbps  - 10 Gbps [cable length under 100 meters]

		- CAT8 - 40 Gbps - ultimate copper cable, shielded (4 times faster than CA6a/CAT7)


- plenum vs. non-plenum cables
	- plenum: open spaces in a building where there is open air flow circulation
		- usually between drop ceiling and structured ceiling
		- more open spaces = more prone to fires
		- plenum cables must be more fire resistant and not produce toxic fumes if they are burned

- coaxial cable
	- used today primarily by cable providers to provide a conputer with a broadband internet connection
	- early on it was used as teh backbone for networks

	- Types:
		- RG-6

	- made for long distnaces

- MMF - Multi Mode Fiber cable
	- light reflects off the walls of the cable
	- made for short distances



# 14) TCP/IP Characteristics

- IP address - a numeric address
						 - an identifier for a computer or device on a network
						 - every device on a network needs to have an IP address to communicate
						 - consists of 2 parts: a network address and a host address
						 - 2 types: IPv4 and IPv6

- IPv4 - current version of IP addresses
			 - 32-bit numeric address written as 4 numbers separated by periods
			 - each number is an octet [0 - 255]
			 - over 4 billion unique addresses

- IPv6 - next generation of IP addresses
			 - 128-bit hexadecimal address
			 - hexadecimal uses both letters and numbers
			 - can produce over 340 undecillion addresses!!!! [340 with 36 0's after it]


- IP address consists of 2 parts: a network address and a host address

- subnet mask - resembles an IP address
							- distinguishes which portion of an IP address belongs to the network or the host
							- reveals how many bits in an IP address are used for the network by masking the network portion of the IP address
								- 255.255.0.0 means the first two octets belong to the network, the 0s belong to the host


							- 3 of the 5 IP classes and ranges:

								- class A
									- supports 16 million hosts on 126 networks
										- mostly for large organizations
									- first octet address: 1-126
									- default subnet mask: 255.0.0.0     -  NNNNNNNN.hhhhhhhh.hhhhhhhh.hhhhhhhh

								- class B
									- supports 65,000 hosts on 16,000 networks
										- medium-sized organizations
									- first octet address: 128-191
									- default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0   -  NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.hhhhhhhh.hhhhhhhh

								- class C
									- supports 254 hosts on 2 million networks
										- for small organizations
									- first octet address: 192-223
									- default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 -  NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.hhhhhhhh

										- where N = network, h = host
										- 127 is reserved for loopback testing [e.g. localhost]

- Dynamic IP
	- a computers get an IP automatically from a DHCP server [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]
		- DHCP can also auto-assign a subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server


- Static IP [or permanent]
	- assigned and changed manually [not thru DHCP]

- Self-assigned [Automatic Private IP Address Assignment or APIPA]
	- if computer cannot reach a DHCP server
	- Windows 98 or later
	- computer will update this later once DHCP server bcomes available



# 15) Well-Known Ports

- logical connection that is used by programs to exchange information
- 2 protocols for ports: TCP and UDP
- identified by a unique number
- range from 0 - 65535

	- connection-oriented protocol [must first acknowledge session btw two computers communicating]
	- guarantees the delivery of data
	- 3 step handshake
		1. source computer sends a SYN message [synchronize sequence numbers message]
		2. destination respond with a SYN ACK [acknowledgement]
		3. source sends an ACK RECEIVED


- UDP - User Datagram Protcol
	- connectionless-oriented protocol
	- does NOT guarantee data delivery [fire and forget protocol]
	- faster than TCP

- LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
	- used to get information from a server

# 17) Wireless Networking

- SOHO router [Small Office / Home Office]
	- primarily for homes and small businesses
	- go to the routers webpage to configure it [check the default gateway IP in your computer to see the router IP]
	
	- basic tabs in webpage: Setup, Wireless, Security, Access Restrictions, Applications and Gaming, Administration, and Status
		- Setup
			- can come with built-in DHCP server
		
		- Wireless
			- SSID - Service Set Identifier - the wireless network name that shows up on a device searching for networks to connect to
			- Channel - can try and adjust the setting if theres any indication of interference with another network

		- Security
			- different options available or can disable
				- WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy [obsolete]
					- provides security for wireless networks, but uses 40 bit encryption key that was found to be easily hackable

				- WPA - Wi-Fi Protected Access

			  	- created to help inexperienced users auth to a wireless network
			  		1. if user has a wifi protected setup button on their device, they can just press it to join [looks like two arrows in a circle], and admin has to click the same button
			  			 on the router config side within 2 minutes to allow the user access
			  		2. if user has WPS PIN number, admin can enter it in the router config side
			  		3. user can enter routers PIN number, given by the administrator to user

			  - MAC filter
			  	- can enter MAC addresses to allow or deny access


				- DMZ - Demilitarized Zone

	- uses terminal adapter, looks similar to a modem



# 19) Types Of Networks

- Toplogies 

	- Star
		- all computers connected to a central hub or switch
			- connections from source to destination have to go through it first

	- Ring
		- each computer is connected to each other in a closed loop
			- each computer has exactly two neighbours
		- each data packet sent around the ring until it arrives at its destination
		- rarely used today 

	- Bus
		- all computers are connected to a single coaxiable cable or "backbone" with a BNC or "T" connector
		- cable has to be terminated at both ends using terminators
		- rarely used today

	- Mesh
		- each computer is directly connected to every other computer on the network
		- handles failures well
		- more cabling and NICs required
		- mostly used on WANs
		- internet itself is on mesh topology

	- Hybrid

- WAN - Wide Area Network
	- connecting a large geographical area, even the entire globe



# 20) Network Components

- hub - connect all network devices together
			- not intelligent, only knows when something is connected to it
			- data is copied/transmitted to all ports which have a connection to it
				- can be a security concern if you dont want every device to see data being transmitted between one device on the network and another [does not filter data]
			- two types:
				- passive: does not require power
				- active: does require power


- switch - like a hub except intelligent, only broadcasts between communicating devices, not every device on network
			   - can detect specific devices that are connected to it
			   - keeps track of mac addresses of the devices connected in a table
			   - reduces traffic, better security
			   

- both of the above
			- for internal communication within a network
			- cannot read IP addresses

				 - inspects packet for the IP address before it routes it
				 - the gateway of a network
				 	 - accepts only packets fron the internet intended for its own network
				 - used to connect networks


- firewall - doorway to a network
					 - controls communication coming into and out of a network
					 - examines data packets and allows/denies entry based on rules set by administrator
					 - most firewalls are hardware, but there are software firewalls as well

- modem - a device that allows a computer to transmit data over telephone lines
			  - converts analog data [coming in from telephone line] to digital for computer to understand
			  - 56 Kbps max speed

- may have a VGA, DVI or HDMI video port

- two main types of monitors:

	- CRT - Cathode Ray Tube
		- first technology used in TV sets, almost non-existent in marketplace today
		- bulky, heavy, take up a lot of space
		- uses 3 colour electron guns [red, blue, green] to produce image on screen
			- sweeps/shoots beams of electrons on-screen repeatedly per second to create the images we see

		- constantly redrawing the image - "refresh rate"
			- measured in Hz
				- refresh rate of 60Hz = redraws image 60 times per second
					- 60Hz can be noticeable, incrase to 75Hz

		- shadow mask - a metal plate insde CRT monitor
									- can pick up outside external magnetic fields which can cause discolouration
									- "degaussing" is the process o getting rid of the unwanted magnetic fields
										- usually a degauss button on the monitor [or done automatically when monitor is turned on]


	- LCD - Liquid Crystal Display
		- produce an image on a flat surface by using liquid crystals
		- light shines through the crystals to produce the image on-screen
		- first used in laptop computers, now have completely replaced CRTs
		- lighter, thinner, take up less space
		- aka "flat panel displays"

		- TFT - Thin Film Transistor
			- modern LCDs use this
			- uses thin film transistor to create a higher quality image
			- each pixel on-screen has its own transistor


- resolution - the number of pixels that are used to display an image on screen

	- eg. 1280 x 720 = 921,600 pixels being used
	- the higher the resolution, the higher the number of pixels will be used
	- from 640 x 480 to 1920 x 1220 or more
	- LCDs produce best quality image when they are set to their highest resolution, which is called their "native resolution"

# 27) RAID

- RAID stands for "Redundant Array of Indepdent Disks"
- used for data loss prevention in the event of hardware failure
	- data is spread across multiple disks for fault tolerance

- types:

	- RAID 0
		- not fault tolerant
		- data is 'striped' across multiple disks
			- eg. disk A would have certain parts of the data, disk B would have the other parts. If one of these disks fail, all of the data would be lost
		- advantage: speed
			- 2 disk controllers instead of one, makes data access much faster

	- RAID 1
		- fault tolerant
		- data is copied on more than 1 disk [duplicate copy of the data across each disk]
			- i.e. each disk has the same data 
		- 2 different setups
			- mirroring - when all the disks use the same controller
			- duplexing	- when each disk has its own controller [therefore, more fault tolerant than mirroring]


	- RAID 5
		- requires 3 or more disks
		- fast and can store a large amount of data
		- can handle single disk failure, cannot handle two disk failures at the same time
		- data is not duplicated but striped across multiple disks along with "parity"
			- parity
				- an entire copy of the data across each disk
				- used to rebuild a failed disk
				- eg. an array of 4 disks totaling 4 TB
					- only 3 TB used for data storage
					- 1 TB used to store parity for rebuilding any of the 4 disks in the event of failure

	- RAID 6
		- requires 4 or more disks
		- 50% capacity used for data storage

		- like RAID 5 in terms of data striping, but parity is spread TWICE on each disk
			- can handle 2 disk failures at the same time [rare occurrence]
				- if 2 drives fail at the same time, double parity from other disks would be used to rebuild the data on the new drives

		- read performance is the same between RAID 5 and 6
		- write performance is slower because it has to write 2 independent parity blocks instead of 1


	- RAID 10
		- combines RAID 0 and 1 together
		- benefits of RAID fault tolerance from RAID 1 with the speed from RAID 0
			- downside: can only use 50% of the capacity for data storage
		- minimum of 4 disks needed
		- RAID 0 pointing to 2 RAID 1 sets of 2 disks 
			- RAID 0 -> RAID 1 -> disk 1 
												 -> disk 2
							 -> RAID 1 -> disk 3
							 					 -> disk 4



# 28) Safety and Professionalism Tips

- ESD - Electrostatic Discharge
	- when two objects of the opposite charge come in contact with each other [e.g. your finger and a computer part], and the charge damages the component
	
	- prevention
		- wear an ESD wrist strap to prevent ESD
			- one end attaches to your wrist and the other end [wire] is grounded [power outlet or clipped onto metal case of computer]
	
		- ESD mat
			- removes any electrical charge from components that are placed on it


- MSDS - Meterial Data Safety Sheet
	- computer equipment contains lead and mercury that is harmful to the environment
		- MSDS tells you how to properly dispose of a particular piece of equipment


- Safety Tips
	- turn off the power and unplug the power cable before any hardware repair work
	
	- remove any jewelery
	
	- Class C fire exinguisher availability
	
	- cable management
		- make sure neatly organized along floor
			- relocate any that run across a walkway [or use cable cover]
	
	- proper lifting
		- feet shoulder width apart, squat down, keep back straight, slowly lift by straightening your legs


- Professionalism Tips
	- use proper language
	- avoid jargon, slang and bad words
	- dont talk down to customer
	- listen to the customer
	- be sensitive and understanding
	
	- be on time/punctual
		- be sure to call if you are going to be late
	
	- avoid distractions when communicating with the customer
		- turn off distractions like TV
		- make sure no one bothering you during conversation with customer
	
	- dealing with difficult customers
		- do not get defensive
		- remain calm
		- do not minimize customers problems
		- listen and be sensitive to their needs
		- ask open-ended questions
			- narrow down, be accurate about the problem they are having
		- re-state their problem to them to confirm you understand their issue
		- set expectations with the customer
		- provide proper documentation about the repair
		- follow up with the customer
		- ask them if they are satisfied
		- keep the customers backup data in a safe place
			- once their data is restored, erase their data from the backup device
