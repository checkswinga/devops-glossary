Filesystem types
----------------
auto - this is a special one. It will try to guess the fs type when you use this.

ext4 - this is probably the most common Linux fs type of the last few years

ext3 - this is the most common Linux fs type from a couple years back

ntfs - this is the most common Windows fs type or larger external hard drives

vfat - this is the most common fs type used for smaller external hard drives

exfat - is also a file system option commonly found on USB flash drives and other external drives

glusterfs - for Gluster

zfs - an advanced fs fype that pools disk storage

Mounting a Volume
-----------------

Source article: https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/block-storage/how-to-use-block-storage-with-your-linode/#add-a-volume-from-the-linode-detail-page

# One-time step for defining the FS type of the volume
mkfs.ext4 $volume_path   # check the file system path of the volume in your cloud console, it will show you the device drive location

# Steps for mounting the volume
mkdir /mnt/my-volume
mount $volume_path /mnt/my-volume
df -h

# Create entry in /etc/fstab:
FILE_SYSTEM_PATH /mnt/my-volume ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail 0 2

* noatime - This will save space and time by preventing writes made to the filesystem for data being read on the volume.
* nofail - If the volume is not attached, this will allow your server to boot/reboot normally without hanging at dependency failures if the volume is not attached.



# if you need to unmount it or reboot your Linode without affecting the volume
umount /mnt/my-volume
Remove /etc/fstab entry

netstat
